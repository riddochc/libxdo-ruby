libxdo-ruby
===========

ruby ffi bindings to libxdo

libxdo is part of xdotool and can be found on github at:
https://github.com/riddochc/libxdo-ruby

Note: this needs to be made more library-like and gem-ified before it is
very usable.

The script currently just finds the current window, types "ls -l" into it,
and hits return.  This will probably show you a listing of files in the
current directory, unless you have a program named 'ls' that is very
different from mine.

== Dependencies ==

ruby's ffi library: https://github.com/ffi/ffi
